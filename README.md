# Prompt
In the JSON, you'll find a sample response of property objects.

I'd like for you to create an endpoint in your backend that will be called by your front end to fetch the data. Then using react and redux, you should display the listings and the data you deem appropriate (including tags mapped to properties).

Once you're done with that, we'd like to see if you can build some filter functionality to show listings according to the filters.

Please do not upload this on Github. We might be able to set up a private repo for you to use after the weekend but for now, your local git will have to do.
